# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

  - Reporting a bug
  - Discussing the current state of the code
  - Submitting a fix
  - Proposing new features
  - Becoming a maintainer

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

  1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
  2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
  3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
  4. Ensure the test suite passes.
  5. Make sure your code lints.
  6. Issue that pull request!

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/dotiful/web-template/issues/new/choose) it's that easy!

## Pull Request Process

  1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
    build.
  2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
    variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
  3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
    Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
  4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you 
    do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Submitting changes

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding Style  
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* 80 character line length
